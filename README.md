# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

The structure of the project has 3 files: 

* milestone_2.py which is the initial functionalities to play the game: 
  - random selection of a word from a list
  - user input request for a letter
  - checks on the input format
  - checks if the letter is in the secret word

* milestone_3.py which refactors the code as functions moving one step closer to create a class
* milestone_4.py implementation of previous functionalities in a class. The method to get the user input does not have logic to break out of its loop
* milestone_5.PY fully implemented class and the function that runs it in a loop until the game ends. Just run the file in a terminal to play!
